:toc: macro

== Example Asciidoc Post ==
This is an example asciidoc post.

You can use a manually placed table of contents by setting `:toc false` in the front matter, but use `:toc: macro` at the top of the post, and `toc::[]` where the table of contents is supposed to be, like here:

toc::[]

=== Section 1 ===

.Heading

With some text and maybe even a bulleted list:  

- Thing 1  
- Thing 2  

Or how about some *bold* or _italicized_ text?

=== Section 2 ===

Will a code snippet work?  

.bash
[source,bash]
----
$ echo "foo"
----

.clojure
[source,clojure]
----
(defn echo [s]
  (println s))
----
