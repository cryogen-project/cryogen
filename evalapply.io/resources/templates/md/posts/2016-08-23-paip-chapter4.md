This is the chapter of [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp](http://amzn.to/29CsgBt) (PAIP) that dives into Common Lisp syntax.

## Summary for Chapter 4: GPS: The General Problem Solver

The chapter starts with a quote by Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize winner and of the inventors of the *General Problem Solver*:

>*There are now in the world machines that think.*

The GPS was not as general as its name suggests.
According to Norvig the exaggerated claims probably had to do with the complex code: if the code is so complex the program must do something interesting.

We'll use the following stages in development to build our GPS.

- Describe
- Specify
- Implement
- Test
- Debug and analyze

This will be reflected in the exercises.
