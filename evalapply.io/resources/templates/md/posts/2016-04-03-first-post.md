This is a blog about Lisps, life and sometimes Scala.

One of the things that was difficult not to take away from John Sonmez' book [Soft Skills - The software developer's life manual](http://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397) is that I had to start a blog. Starting a blog is a good idea because, among [other things](http://howtostartablogonline.net/why-blog/), I will learn from the topics I write about (you sharpen your thinking), I learn to write better, and it helps my visibility. With this blog I hope to improve myself as a programmer and writer and to start conversations with other people.

In the book John Sonmez explains that when you want to do something it is a good idea to create a 'quota' for yourself (e.g., go to the gym three times a week). The idea is that you make a strong promise to yourself and you stick with it for a week. Then after a week you reevaluate your quota and adjust it. But you have to stick it. I like this idea, and one of my quota is that I want to create one long (> 1000 words) post a week on a technical or more philosophical subject.

I really wanted to add the following quote to this first post:
> Wishful thinking is essential to good engineering. ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erHp3r6PbJk&t=50m35s))

I feel that it somehow related to what I am doing here, but I cannot exactly pinpoint it. Maybe I can explain it after the blog has sharpened my thinking.

The blog is created with [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) -- a static site content generator built in Clojure. At the moment I am writing this I am using the default template and features of Cryogen. If I can hold on to my commitment and also blog about improving the site itself I hope it will look like something in a year or two. Stay tuned. :)
