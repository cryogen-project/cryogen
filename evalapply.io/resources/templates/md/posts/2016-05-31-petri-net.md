## Building similar things

I think it is not uncommon in enterprise organizations that different teams are building the same things. 
Independently from and unaware of each other similar software systems are implemented using similar technologies. 

For example, if an organization has a service oriented architecture, team after team will be creating the code to interact with these services and perform logic based on the responses, unaware that other teams have already built it before. 

The complexity in the code are usually not the code that uses various components (like code that connects with services). 
Complexity usually is in the logic or flow that uses the various components.
E.g., if this step has happened then I can do this but if it has not happened and this data is not available then we can do that, and otherwise the step has failed.

Two months ago when we started building a complex application that uses lots of components, we decided to not do the same thing. 
We wanted to aim for flexibility, encapsulation and reusability. For this we use Petri nets and recipes.

## Petri nets to model business processes

One of my team members was very enthusiastic about something called a Petri net. 
He simply had never seen a better way to model business processes. 
First I was skeptical, but now I am convinced about them as well. 

Petri nets were invented by Carl Adam Petri in 1939 when he was just 13 years old. 
He used it to describe a chemical process, but it can just as well be used for a business process. 

A Petri net looks something like this:

(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net))

In the example Petri net above we see places (circles), transitions (rectangles) and arcs (one-way connections). 
Places only connect with transitions and transitions only connect with places. 
In the places tokens can exist (the dots that appear). 
Tokens can be consumed and produced by transitions. 
Once all places that move towards a transition (in-adjacent) are filled, 
the transition can *consume* the tokens, and thereby *produce* new tokens in the places that come out of it (out-adjacent) to it. 
Parallelism is supported (e.g., multiple places coming out of a transition or multiple places leading to one place).
With this mathematical modelling language you can model all kind of processes. 

A colored Petri net is a special type of Petri net where the tokens can also have data. 
We use such a colored Petri net to model methods on components and events as transitions, and the data they need or provide as places.

Since lots of research (especially in Europe) has been done on Petri nets certain properties can be proved about them. Properties like 
[reachability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Reachability) ("can we reach a certain state?"),
[liveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Liveness) ("can a transition fire?"),
[boundedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Boundedness) ("how many tokens can there be?").

Properties like the above are useful for example for showing how much memory a process will consume or to say things about the validity of the business process. 
By using Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) to describe the Petri net analysis can be done via existing tools.

Now all we need was a way to use this model. 
For this we decided to create a domain specific language (DSL). 

## The recipe DSL

To tackle the complexity of combining components we decided to model our process with a recipe. 
The ingredients of are recipe are the software components used (e.g., a service client). 
On ingredients specific actions can be performed (e.g., `TomatoesService` has an action `cut()` to cut the tomatoes).
Actions can have preconditions, they can generate new data or create an event. 
Preconditions mean for example that an action can only execute if data is provided or an event has happened before. 

So, just like in a real recipe, we can start cutting tomatoes once when we have tomatoes and a knife. 
And once we have cut the tomatoes we have a new event: `TomatoesAreCut` which provides the cut tomatoes as data. 

I find a recipe quite a strong anology and it works well. 
It has been used before. In Martin Fowlers's 
<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321712943/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321712943&linkCode=as2&tag=evalapply-20&linkId=3SPQRLBJR4DOJUDA">Domain-Specific Languages</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=evalapply-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321712943" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> 
I saw this analogy popping up as well. 

Now I will show how we started implementing this by combining the idea of the recipe and the Petri net. 

## Implementation 

The current DSL is implemented as a map with as keys the interface of the ingredient and as value a list of actions that can be performed on the ingredient. 
Actions are value objects that have some properties like which preconditions they have and which events they have to return. 
A simple recipe for cooking pasta looks as follows:

```
/* Interfaces to components */
trait PastaMaker {
  @FiresEvent("PastaCookedSuccessfully")
  def cookPasta(@Requires("boiledWater") boiledWater: Water): Pasta

  @FiresEvent(oneOf(SauceAddedSuccessfully, AddingSauceFailed))
  def combinePastaAndSauce(@Requires("cookedPasta") cookedPasta: Pasta, @Requires("pastaSauce") pastaSauce: Sauce)

  /* (...) */
}

/* Events */
case class SauceAddedSuccessfully
case class AddingSauceFailed
case class PastaCookedSuccessfully(cookedPasta: Pasta)
case class WaterBoiling(boiledWater: Water)
case class PastaSauceReady(pastaSauce: Sauce)
/* (...) */

type Recipe = Map[Class[_], Seq[Action]]

val recipe: Recipe = Map(
  classOf[PastaMaker] -> Seq(
    new Action("servePasta").
      withPreconditions(Set[Class[_]](classOf[SauceAddedSuccessfully])).
    new Action("cookPasta"),
    /* (...) */
  )
)

```

Notes: 
* Later we want to create a more readable DSL that is parsed or perhaps even created visually or from sequence diagrams to come up to this intermediate representation. But for now the above is workable. Since we might end up changing things a bit more later we decided not to go overboard with this. I enjoy the way of working where we keep everything as simple as possible and cut corners as much as possible so that if someone pops up we always have something to demo. 
* Because it is not possible on the JVM to read parameter names we have to provide extra annotations on the methods in the ingredient.
* Method names are [stringly typed](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StringlyTyped) in the `Action`s. Later we will change this by for example [compile time annotations](https://deors.wordpress.com/2011/10/08/annotation-processors/) on the ingredients.

Next up we have the chef.
The chef is a class that takes a recipe, ingredient implementations (so we can also provide mocks at test time) and the events as constructor arguments. 
Once the chef has the recipe it will create the Petri net topology. 
The chef does this by using reflection to get all the information out of the recipe and the ingredients. 
The Petri net is modelled using the [Kagera](https://github.com/merlijn/kagera) library (Kagera is an East African river).
The chef can then cook meals based on this recipe if it is requested to do so. 
By reading the recipes and cooking meals the chef has one Petri net, and a state of the Petri net for every process that is running identified by a process identifier (UUID) (the meals). 
The chef can listen to things that are happening and knows how to act accordingly (e.g., when the water starts boiling the chef knows that she can start cooking the pasta). 

Here we see what the chef looks like (without implementations): 

```scala
class Chef(recipe: Map[Class[_], Seq[Action]],
           ingredientImpls: Map[Class[_], AnyRef],
           events: Set[Class[_]]) {

  /* Cook the recipe for a specific process id */
  def cook(processId: java.util.UUID): Unit = /* (...) */ 

  /* Get all accumulated state from the Petri net marking */
  def getAccumulatedState(processId: java.util.UUID): Map[String, Optional[Any]] = /* (...) */ 

  /* Tell the chef an event has happened for a specific process id */
  def tellEventHappened(processId: java.util.UUID, event: AnyRef): Unit = /* (...) */ 

  /* Get the GraphViz implementation of the recipe */
  def getVisualRecipe: String = /* (...) */ 

  /* Get the PNML (Petri Net Modelling Language) representation of the recipe */
  def getPnmlRecipe: String = /* (...) */ 
}

```

So the chef can cook a new meal based on the recipe, we can retrieve all state of a Petri net instance (this is called a marking), we can tell the chef an event has happened and we can get the [GraphViz](www.graphviz.org/) and PNML representations of the recipe. 
We provide a Java interface next to the Scala one as well. 

If we get the GraphViz representation of the above recipe (with some places and arcs automatically removed for esthetic reasons) it looks like this: 
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZTpcOE5.png">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZTpcOE5.png" alt="GraphViz visualization of recipe" />
</a>

Now, to use the chef we depend on the DSL library and provide the chef with a recipe and the ingredients we want to use.
And in our actual application (a REST API), when one of the endpoints is called, we create an event with the data provided (if any) and tell the chef via `tellEventHappend`.

This way logic in the API roughly looks like this:

```
@Autowired
private JChef chef;

@POST
@Path("pastaSauce")
public Response waterBoiling(UUID processId, Sauce sauce) {
    chef.tellEventHappened(processId, new PastaSauceReady(sauce));

    return Response.ok().build();
}
```

We inject one instance of our Java Chef using Spring's [Autowired](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html) 
annotation in the controller. 
Once the API is called on the method `waterBoiling` we tell the chef the `PastaSauceReady` event has happened and provide the sauce as data.
All logic on what to do next is encapsulated in the chef and provided by the recipe. 

## Conclusion and implications

By using the modelling language of Petri nets and creating a recipe DSL we have facilitated reuse, flexibility and encapsulation of complexity in our modelling of a business process. 
Changing a business process has become as easy as changing the recipe. 
In theory, business analysts can read or view the recipe and see if it adheres to their ideas. 
The chef should even be able to tell if it can cook the recipe. 
In theory, it is possible to share ingredients with other teams and let them create new recipes. 
Logic on handling process flows might in the future be done in a way similar to this. 
And where in classically build APIs it can be difficult to trace where things went wrong, because of the properties of Petri and by using [event sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) it is possible to do thorough analysis on the flows taken through the application. 

It is not all sunshine and moonlight. There are some limitations:
* The chef and recipe DSL might be a bit slow so it should probably not be used for performance critical applications. 
* It is best suited for large and complicated business processes. It might introduce too much complexity for simple processes. 
* We do need to improve our error-handling strategies and process analytics. 
* The DSL itself needs to be improved.
* If other teams will be using something like this as well it might be a bit difficult for them to get used to. Therefore good documentation and ways to do error analysis will need to be created. 

We have only just started working on this idea, but it looks promising. I am curious about ideas of others regarding this idea of modelling business processes.
