## Building similar things

I think it is not uncommon in enterprise organisations that different teams are building the same things. 
Independently of each other they are implementing similar APIs using similar technologies.
For example, if an organisation has a service oriented architecture, team after team will be creating the code to interact with these services and perform logic based on the responses, unaware that other teams have already built it before. 

The complexity in the code is usually not that part of the code that connects with the services (although it can be lots of work). 
The complexity is in the logic or flow in which to connect with these services.
E.g., if this step has happened then I can do this but if it has not happened and this data is not available then we can do that, and otherwise the step has failed.

An application we have started building two months ago also consists of lots of components. 
Creating service clients and the logic for handling the type of responses we can expect has been done before for most of the components we interact with. 
In the beginning we decided that we were not going to write spaghetti code to connect these components. 
We wanted to aim for reusability, flexibility and encapsulation. 

## Petri nets to model business processes

One of my team members was very enthusiastic about something called a Petri net. 
He simply had never seen a better way to model business processes. 
First I was skeptical, but now I am convinced about them as well. 
Let me explain what it is. 

Petri nets were invented by Carl Adam Petri in 1939 when he was just 13 years old. 
He used it to describe a chemical process, but it can just as well be used for a business process. 
A Petri net looks something like this:

(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net))

In the example Petri net above we see places (circles), transitions (rectangles) and arcs (one-way connections). 
Places only connect with transitions and transitions only connect with places. 
In the places tokens can exist (the dots that appear). 
Tokens can be consumed and produced by transitions. 
Once all places that move towards a transition (in-adjacent) are filled, 
the transition can *consume* the tokens, and thereby *produce* new tokens in the places that come out of it (out-adjacent) to it. 
Tokens and places can be parallel to each other. 
A colored Petri net is a special type of Petri net where the tokens can also have data. 
With this mathemathical modelling language you can model all kind of processes. 

We use a colored Petri net to model methods on components and events as transitions, and the data they need or provide as places.

Since lots of research (especially in Europe) has been done on Petri nets certain properties can be proved about them. Properties like 
[reachability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Reachability) ("can we reach a certain state?"),
[liveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Liveness) ("can a transition fire?"),
[boundedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Boundedness) ("how many tokens can there be?").

Properties like the above are useful for example for showing how much memory a process will consume or about the validity of the business process. 
By using Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) to describe the Petri net analysis can be done via existing tools.

Now all we need was a way to use this model. We decided to create a domain specific language (DSL). 

## The recipe DSL

To tackle the complexity of combining components (building blocks) we decided to model our process with a recipe. 
This is nothing new, in Martin Fowler's 
<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321712943/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321712943&linkCode=as2&tag=evalapply-20&linkId=3SPQRLBJR4DOJUDA">Domain-Specific Languages</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=evalapply-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321712943" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 I saw this anology popping up as well. 

A recipe consits of ingredients and in which way to combine them together. 
On ingredients specific actions can be performed (e.g., tomatoes have an action that is `cut()`).
An action can for example only be executed if data is provided or an event has happened before. 
We can only start cutting tomatoes when we have tomatoes and a knife. 

The current DSL is implemented as a map with as keys the interface of the ingredient and as value a list of actions that can be performed on the ingredient. 
Actions are value objects that have some properties like which preconditions they have and which events they have to return. 
A simple recipe for cooking pasta looks as follows:

```
/* Interfaces to components */
trait PastaMaker {
  @FiresEvent("PastaCookedSuccessfully")
  def cookPasta(@Requires("boiledWater") boiledWater: Water): Pasta

  @FiresEvent(oneOf(SauceAddedSuccessfully, AddingSauceFailed))
  def combinePastaAndSauce(@Requires("cookedPasta") cookedPasta: Pasta, @Requires("pastaSauce") pastaSauce: Sauce)

  /* (...) */
}

/* Events */
case class SauceAddedSuccessfully
case class AddingSauceFailed
case class PastaCookedSuccessfully(cookedPasta: Pasta)
case class WaterBoiling(boiledWater: Water)
case class PastaSauceReady(pastaSauce: Sauce)
/* (...) */

type Recipe = Map[Class[_], Seq[Action]]

val recipe: Recipe = Map(
  classOf[PastaMaker] -> Seq(
    new Action("servePasta").
      withPreconditions(Set[Class[_]](classOf[SauceAddedSuccessfully])).
    new Action("cookPasta"),
    /* (...) */
  )
)

```

Note that later we can create a more readable DSL that is parsed or create otherwise to come to this representation. 
But this is workable for now and since we might up changing things a bit more later we decided not to go overboard with this. 
Also note that because it is not possible on the JVM to read parameter names we have to provide extra annotations on the methods in the ingredient.

Next up we have the chef.
The chef is a class that takes a recipe, ingredient implementations and the events as constructor arguments. 
Once the chef has the recipe it will create the Petri net topology. 
The chef does this by using reflection to get all the information out of the recipe and the ingredients. 
The Petri net is modelled using the [Kagera](https://github.com/merlijn/kagera) library (Kagera is an East African river).
The chef can then cook meals based on this recipe if it is requested to do so. 
By reading the recipes and cooking meals the chef has one Petri net, and a state of the Petri net for every process that is running identified by a process identifier (UUID) (the meals). 

Here we see what the chef looks like (without implementations): 

```scala
class Chef(recipe: Map[Class[_], Seq[Action]],
           ingredientImpls: Map[Class[_], AnyRef],
           events: Set[Class[_]]) {

  /* Cook the recipe for a specific process id */
  def cook(processId: java.util.UUID): Unit = /* (...) */ 

  /* Get all accumulated state from the Petri net marking */
  def getAccumulatedState(processId: java.util.UUID): Map[String, Optional[Any]] = /* (...) */ 

  /* Tell the chef an event has happened for a specific process id */
  def tellEventHappened(processId: java.util.UUID, event: AnyRef): Unit = /* (...) */ 

  /* Get the GraphViz implementation of the recipe */
  def getVisualRecipe: String = /* (...) */ 

  /* Get the PNML (Petri Net Modelling Language) representation of the recipe */
  def getPnmlRecipe: String = /* (...) */ 
}

```

So the chef can cook a new meal based on the recipe, we can retrieve all state of a Petri net instance (this is called a marking), we can tell the chef an event has happened and we can get the [GraphViz](www.graphviz.org/) and PNML representations of the recipe. 
We provide a Scala and Java interface. 

If we get the GraphViz representation of the above recipe (with some places and arcs automatically removed for esthetic reasons) it looks like this: 
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZTpcOE5.png">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZTpcOE5.png" alt="GraphVizGraphViz  visualization of recipe" />
</a>

Now, to use the chef we just depend on the DSL library and provide the chef with a recipe and the ingredients we want to use.
Then when our application is called on one of our endpoints we just create an event with the data provided (if any) and tell the chef.

Logic in the API roughly looks like this:

```
@Autowired
private JChef chef;

@POST
@Path("pastaSauce")
public Response waterBoiling(UUID processId, Sauce sauce) {
    chef.tellEventHappened(processId, new PastaSauceReady(sauce));

    return Response.ok().build();
}
```

We inject one instance of our Java Chef using Spring's [Autowired](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html) 
annotation in the controller. 
Once the API is called on the method `waterBoiling` we tell the chef the `PastaSauceReady` event has happened and provide the sauce as data.
All logic on what to do next is encapsulated in the chef and provided by the recipe. 

## Conclusion and implications

By using the modelling language of Petri nets and creating a recipe DSL we have facilitated reuse, flexibility and encapsulation of complexity in our modelling of a business process. 
Changing a business process has become as easy as changing the recipe. 
Business analysts can easily read the recipe and see if it is correct. 
The chef should even be able to tell if it can cook the recipe. 
In theory it is possible to share ingredients with other teams and let them create new recipes. 
Logic on handling process flows might in the future be done in a way similar to this. 
And where in classically build APIs it can be difficult to trace where things went wrong, because of the properties of Petri and storing all events it is possible to do thorough analysis on the flows taken through the application. 

Of course there are limitations. 
The chef and recipe DSL might be a bit slow so it should probably not be used for performance critical applications. 
It might introduce too much complexity for simple processes. 
It is best suited for large and complicated business processes. 

We are only working on this for a short period of time and need to improve our error-handling strategies and process analytics. 
The recipe DSl can also be improved. 
Furthermore, if other teams will be using something like this as well it might be a bit difficult for them to get use to. 
Good documentation and ways to do error analysis will need to be created.
