## This is a blog about my life, my Clojure journey, and sometimes Scala.

### Who?
I am Erwin Rooijakkers. 
I live in Amsterdam. 
After my studies of Liberal Arts and Sciences (major in Physics and Astronomy) 
and [Transpersonal Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology) 
I developed a strong interest in programming. I had however no idea how to start.
I consider myself lucky that I was accepted in a software engineering traineeship at a Dutch company called [Sogyo](http://www.sogyo.nl/). 
Here I learned about software principles and got exposed to Java, .NET and various other stuff (e.g., Erlang). 
In my free time I coded in Ruby (on Rails) and on Mono. 
Now I work at ING where I do serious business with Scala and Java. 
I love Lisp, functional programming, and life.

### Why?
One of the things that was difficult not to take away from 
[Soft Skills - The software developer's life manual](http://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397) is that you have to start a blog. 
Starting a blog is a good idea because you learn from the topics you write about, you will learn to write better, and it helps your visibility. 
My goal with the blog are exactly those things: to improve myself as a programmer and writer and to start conversations with others.

### What?
I'll try to write one long (> 1.000 words) blog post a week about Clojure, life, Scala or a combination.

### How?
The blog is built using [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/). 
This is a basic static site generator made in Clojure that uses Markdown or AsciiDoc pages and compiles them to HTML. 

### eval apply?
Besides the fact that evaluating and applying is something I do in daily life, I called the blog eval apply as a reference to the the core of the meta-circular evaluator described in the 
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/).
